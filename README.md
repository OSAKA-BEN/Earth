## World Temperature Map - A 3D Interactive Globe

Welcome to the World Temperature Map project! This application is a 3D globe built using D3.js and Three.js libraries, providing an immersive and interactive experience as you float in a starry outer space. The project aims to present global temperatures with a unique and engaging approach.

## Overview

Our World Temperature Map is a globe representation where each country is distinguished by different colors correlating to its current temperature. The data visualization utilized here is a clear and intuitive way to comprehend temperature differences across the world. The 3D rendering of the globe is made possible with D3.js.

Clicking on any country redirects you to a Google search of the selected country. This provides quick access to a plethora of additional information, making it an effective educational tool.

The experience is augmented by the simulated outer space environment with stars, complete with a starry background created using the Three.js library. This library enables the creation of 3D animations directly in the browser.

## Key Features

- Interactive 3D Globe: Visualize the world in a way flat maps can't match. Rotate and explore the globe with ease.
- Temperature Visualization: Different colors represent the temperature of each country, providing an instant understanding of global temperature distribution.
- Direct Google Search: A simple click on a country will take you to a Google search result page of that country, facilitating easy access to further information.
- Immersive Background: With the use of Three.js, the application is set against a starry space backdrop to enhance the user experience.

## Technologies Used

This project is implemented using D3.js for data visualization and Three.js for 3D modeling and animation. It is fully web-based, requiring no additional software to run. The project takes advantage of modern web technologies and APIs to provide a smooth, interactive experience.
